# Toohak

## Description

Toohak is a game-based learning platform, used as educational technology in schools and other educational institutions. It allows teachers to create quizzes which can be accessed by students through a fully responsive web browser. With its interactive and engaging format, Toohak promotes active learning and helps educators assess student understanding in real-time.

## Features

- **Create Engaging Content:** Teachers can create dynamic quizzes tailored to their curriculum and students' needs. With customizable features such as double boost or hints, Toohak makes learning interactive and fun.
  
- **Host Live Games:** Teachers can host live games where students join using a unique game PIN. During the game, questions are displayed on a shared screen, and students answer using their own devices. This real-time interaction fosters engagement and collaboration among students.

- **Double Boost:** Teachers can designate certain questions for a double boost, where correct answers earn students double points, adding an extra element of excitement and challenge to the game.

- **Hint Feature:** Students have the option to use a hint during the game, which reduces their collected points by half. This feature encourages strategic thinking and decision-making.

- **Draft Mode:** Teachers can create quizzes in draft mode, allowing them to work on their content over multiple sessions before starting a proper game.

- **Hardcore Mode:** For an added challenge, teachers can enable hardcore mode, where students finish the game if they answer a question incorrectly, or proceed to the next question only if they answer correctly or provide no answer. This mode encourages careful consideration of each question and reinforces learning through immediate feedback.

- **Detailed Feedback:** Students receive detailed information and statistics about their answers, including average response time and percentage of correct answers. This feedback helps students identify areas for improvement and track their progress over time.
