- **Hardcore Mode:** For an added challenge, teachers can enable hardcore mode, where students finish the game if they answer a question incorrectly, or proceed to the next question only if they answer correctly or provide no answer. This mode encourages careful consideration of each question and reinforces learning through immediate feedback.

- **Detailed Feedback:** Students receive detailed information and statistics about their answers, including average response time and percentage of correct answers. Also, after each round players receive some information about their current position. This feedback helps students identify areas for improvement and track their progress over time.
